# About

This repo provides Matlab implementation of a method for clustering high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models using the EM algorithm. 

## How to use

The main function is CHIME.m. The other files are auxiliary functions needed for implementing the main function. 

## Method

Details of the method are available in [our paper](http://drjingma.com/papers/cai-chime). The current code only implements 2-component Gaussian mixture models, but generalization is straightforward.
